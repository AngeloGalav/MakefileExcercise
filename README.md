# Makefile excercise

This is an exercise in understanding how a makefile works so that it's portable and can easily be modified for future use.

## Why did I make this?

I switched from using a 1000 editors to just using VS Code for all my languages. I needed an easy way to compile programs tho, especially C++ since it's the language I use the most. Also, I don't like CMake.

## Features

It's cross compatibile with Windows and Linux, and creates an executable file that has the name of your project folder in order to keep things neat.
